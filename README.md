# College Alumni Website using HTML/CSS

Hi, this website was made by my team and I as a part of my 6th Semester web development project. I worked on most of the css and the landing page and was assisted by my team mates in the remaning pages. Thanks!

## Steps:
- download all files and place them in one folder
- open 'index2.html'

## INFO
- index2.html serves as landing page
- login.html serves as login page
- networking.html shows the ALUMNI Database

## CSS
- style2.css to beautify the main page
- style_login.css to beautify the login page
- mostly learnt to use hover, before/after and other such effects in CSS with usage of Class selectors, universal selectors.
